This book aims to provide my results to the different problems within *Time Series Analysis and Its Application, with R examples*, by Robert H. Shumway and David S. Stoffer [1]. The applied exercises will be solved using the language **Julia** (https://julialang.org) when it is possible.

This book is compiled using R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).
