Shumway and David S. Stoffer (Shumway and Stoffer 2011). The applied exercises will be solved using the language Julia (https://julialang.org) when it is possible. This book is compiled using R Markdown and bookdown (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). References "],
["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!
